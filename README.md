![Online Test Platform Folder Structure](./ProjectAssets/FolderStructureFinal.png)
## Project Overview

This platform provides an exam environment where users:

- Register and login securely using JWT authentication.
- Receive a fixed set of 30 exam questions.
- Answer questions within a timed interface.
- Submit answers to the backend for scoring.
- View detailed results indicating which answers were correct or wrong and their final percentage score.

***

## Features

- User registration and login with password hashing.
- JWT-protected routes for exam questions and submission.
- Fixed 30-question exam for all users.
- Timer countdown with auto-submit on expiration.
- Answer navigation with question-wise selection.
- Backend scoring with detailed feedback per question.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, CORS
- Frontend: React.js, Axios, Bootstrap
- Environment variables managed via `.env`


This project uses MongoDB Atlas as a secure, cloud‚Äëhosted database to store user data, exam questions, and results. The backend connects to it via the MONGO_URI in the .env file.

***

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MALLIKHARJUNCHILUKURI-02/Online-Test-Platform-React-App-.git
cd Online-Test-Platform-React-App-
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd Server
npm install
```

- Create a `.env` file in the `Server` folder with:

```
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
PORT=5000

```

- Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm start
```

The React app will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

***

## Running the Application

1. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Register a new user.
3. Login with your credentials.
4. The exam will start with 30 questions and a timer.
5. Navigate through questions, select answers, and submit before time runs out.
6. View your detailed results and percentage score.

## Running Your Project

### Backend (Server)

1. Navigate to your backend folder:

```bash
cd Server
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Ensure your `.env` file exists in the `Server` folder with the following environment variables:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

4. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

*Note:* This requires a `"start": "node index.js"` script in your `package.json`.  
By default, the backend server will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

***

### Frontend (Client)

1. Navigate to your frontend folder:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This runs your frontend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and will usually open the app automatically in your default browser.

***
